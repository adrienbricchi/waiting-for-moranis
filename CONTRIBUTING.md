## Importing project

##### Setup in IntelliJ or Android Studio :

- Preferences → Plugins...
- Search and install `Lombok`
- File → Open...
- Open the `build.gradle` file
- Enable Auto-import
- Go to Preferences → Build, Execution, Deployment → Compiler → Annotation Processors
- Check Enable annotation processing


## Code style and project structure

The `.idea` folder has been committed. It should bring the appropriate code-style.  
Obviously, every modified file should be auto-formatted before any git push.  
No hook would reject a mis-formatted file for now... But if everything goes bananas, we may set it up.
